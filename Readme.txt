Assignment Prompt:

Implement the Ch. 4 brute-force-median-string algorithm (BruteForceMedianSearch or SimpleMedianSearch), and the Ch. 5 greedy algorithm for motif search. The branch-and-bound-median-string algorithm may be done for extra credit.
A. Time the algorithms for inputs that you can find on-line, using ATGC representation and for relatively small values of l, say, between 5 and 10 (note the complexity of the brute-force algorithm of O(nt 4^l)), and compare. There is also a sample in the book slides file, Ch04_Motifs.pdf. Do at least two samples using ATGC representation.
B. Repeat for DNA sequences generated at random.
Apart from the motifs related output, you need to give timing results. For B, time the following: (1) T(n) as a function of n for fixed values of t and l; (2) T(t) as a function of t for fixed values of n and l; (3) T(l) as a function of l for fixed values of n and t.
Implement the Gibbs Algorithm from section 12.2 of the book for additional extra credit.
